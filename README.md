# Personal_secretary
The Personal Secretary is a helpful tool designed to assist you in creating a daily to-do list for the upcoming week. It aims to alleviate the frustration of facing numerous deadlines by helping you prioritize tasks based on their urgency and importance. By utilizing an Urgent & Importance matrix, the Personal Secretary enables you to make wise decisions about task allocation, reducing stress and increasing productivity. It will give you daily to-do list without any due date, to make you less stressed.

**How to Run the Application**

Ensure that both personal_secretary.py and buttons.py files are present in your working directory.
There are two options to run the application:

Option 1: Open the terminal, navigate to the working directory, and run python3 personal_secretary.py.

Option 2: Open personal_secretary.py in your preferred IDE and click the "Run" button.


**How to Use the Application**

Upon running the application, a graphical user interface (GUI) window will appear.
Input the details of each task using the required format:

Task: Enter a brief description of the task.

Time to finish (hr): Specify the estimated time required to complete the task in hours. It is recommended to allocate at least 1 hour and no more than 20 hours.

Deadline (MM-DD): Enter the deadline for the task in the format of MM-YY (e.g., 6-30 or 06-30). The year information is automatically inferred by the application.

Importance: Assign an importance rating to the task using an integer from 1 to 10, where 1 represents the least important and 10 represents the most important.

After entering the information for each task, click the "Add a task" button. The task will be added to the corresponding list box, either tasks to be done in the next week or tasks without a specific deadline.
To remove a task, select it from the list and click the "Delete task" button.
Once all tasks are entered, you can click the "Draw an Urgent & Important matrix quadrant" button to visualize your tasks with numbered dots. The list of all tasks will be displayed accordingly.
Clicking the "Arrange them!" button will generate an output file named "To do list for next week.txt" containing the arranged daily to-do list.

I hope that the Personal Secretary simplifies your task management process, allowing you to prioritize effectively and achieve your goals with less stress. Happy organizing!
